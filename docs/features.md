## Reflecting on classes not yet loaded

In most cases, creating reflections using a built-in `SourceLocator` or the
`ReflectionClass::createFromName()` technique don't attempt to load code. This
means if a class has not already been declared, you can safely assume that
Better Reflection won't load the class.

Note that if the class is *already* loaded, then this Better Reflection does
not then *unload* that class - this is not currently possible in PHP.

## Reflecting on things within a string

## AST extraction from Reflections
